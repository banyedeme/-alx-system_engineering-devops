0x15-API

This project introduces learners to understanding APIs.

The JSONPlaceholder REST API was provided for this project.
What is an API?

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of protocols, tools, and routines for building software applications. APIs provide a way for different software applications to communicate with each other, allowing developers to integrate external services into their own applications.
What is RESTful API?

REST, or Representational State Transfer, is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used when creating web services. A RESTful API is an API that conforms to these constraints.
Key Concepts

    API: An interface that allows applications to communicate with each other.

    REST: An architectural style that defines a set of constraints for building web services.

    RESTful API: An API that conforms to the constraints defined by the REST architectural style.

    Resources: Data objects that can be accessed and manipulated through the API.

    HTTP Methods: Verbs used to interact with resources, including GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

RESTful API Design Principles

To design a RESTful API, developers should consider the following principles:

    Client-Server Architecture: Separating the user interface concerns from data storage concerns.

    Statelessness: Each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot rely on any context stored on the server.

    Cacheability: Responses to requests must be able to be cached or not cached by clients.

    Layered System: A client cannot tell whether it is connected directly to the end server or to an intermediary along the way.

    Uniform Interface: The same resource should be accessible through a consistent interface, regardless of the type of resource or the location of the resource.

RESTful API Best Practices

To create a well-designed RESTful API, developers should follow these best practices:

    Use nouns instead of verbs in endpoints.

    Use HTTP methods correctly, such as GET for reading data and POST for creating data.

    Use HTTP status codes correctly, such as 200 for a successful response and 404 for a resource not found.

    Support versioning to allow future changes without breaking existing clients.

    Provide comprehensive documentation for the API.

Tasks 📃

    0. Gather data from an API
        0-gather_data_from_an_API.py: Python script that returns information on the to-do list progress of a given employee ID.
        Usage: python3 0-gather_data_from_an_API.py <employee ID>.
        Output: Employee <employee name> is done with tasks(<# completed tasks>/<total # tasks>):

    1. Export to CSV
        1-export_to_CSV.py: Python script exports to-do list information of a given employee ID to CSV format.
        Usage: python3 1-export_to_CSV.py <employee ID>
        File name: <user id>.csv.
        Format: "<user id>","<username>","<task completed status>","<task title>".

    2. Export to JSON
        2-export_to_JSON.py: Python script that exports to-do list information of a given employee ID to JSON format.
        Usage: python3 2-export_to_JSON.py <employee ID>
        File name: <user id>.json
        Format: { "<user id>": [ {"task": "<task title>", "completed": <task completed status>, "username": "<username>"}}, ... ]}

    3. Dictionary of list of dictionaries
        3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries.py: Python script that exports to-do list information for all employees to JSON format.
        Usage: python3 3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries.py
        File name: todo_all_employees.json
        Format: { "<user id>": [ {"username": "<username>", "task": "<task title>", "completed": <task completed status>}, {"username": "<username>", "task": "<task title>", "completed": <task completed status>}, ... ], "<user id>": [ {"username": "<username>", "task": "<task title>", "completed": <task completed status>}, {"username": "<username>", "task": "<task title>", "completed": <task completed status>}, ... ]}
