SERVER CRASH INCIDENT REPORT

Issue summary

Duration:

    Start Time: February 16, 2024, 10:15 AM UTC
    End Time: February 16, 2023, 12:45 AM UTC

Impact: The outage affected the availability of our retail online store website. Users experienced slow page load times, and approximately 50% of users were unable to complete transactions during the outage.
Timelines (UTC+3)

Detection: February 16, 2024, 10:15 AM UTC The issue was detected through automated monitoring alerts on elevated response times and error rates.

Actions Taken:

    11:20 AM UTC: The operations team began investigating server logs and identified a surge in database connection attempts.
    11:20 AM UTC: Assumed the issue might be due to a DDoS attack, initiated traffic analysis, but no malicious activity was detected.
    11:35 AM UTC: Realized the database was under stress, focused investigation on database performance.
    11:45 AM UTC: Identified inefficient queries causing a spike in CPU usage on the database server.

Misleading Paths: Investigated network issues initially, leading to a temporary misallocation of resources. Explored the possibility of a recent code deployment causing issues, but version control and rollbacks proved this assumption wrong. Escalation:

    11:48 AM UTC: Incident escalated to the development team to optimize database queries. 11:50 AM UTC: Communications team informed for customer-facing updates. Resolution:
    11:55 AM UTC: The development team optimized database queries, reducing the load on the database server.
    12:00 AM UTC: Normal website functionality restored; users experienced improved page load times.

Root Cause and Resolution

Root Cause: The primary issue was identified as a sudden surge in traffic triggering inefficient database queries. These queries, compounded by increased user load, created a bottleneck in database connections.

Resolution: Database queries were optimized to reduce the load on the server. Additionally, a caching mechanism was implemented to mitigate future spikes in traffic, ensuring smoother scalability.
Corrective and Preventative Measures

Improvements/Fixes:

Implement enhanced monitoring to proactively identify and address traffic spikes. Conduct regular performance testing to optimize database queries and server configurations.

Tasks:

Short-Term: Introduce caching mechanisms for handling sudden surges in traffic. Adjust monitoring thresholds to prompt earlier alerts in the face of abnormal traffic patterns.

Medium-Term: Establish a routine for regular reviews and optimizations of database performance. Conduct postmortem assessments to enhance incident response and communication protocols.

Long-Term: Investigate load balancing solutions for efficient traffic distribution. Engage in collaborations with infrastructure providers to ensure readiness for scalable resources during peak periods.
Conclusion

This event underscored the importance of proactive monitoring, effective communication during outages, and ongoing optimization of systems to maintain a smooth user experience. The implemented corrective and preventive actions are intended to strengthen our infrastructure against comparable issues in the future.
